# Day3 Lab1: Swift Basics 2

## Topics
1. Optionals
2. Dictionaries
3. Conditionals
   - If
   - Switch
4. Loops
5. Reuse
   - Functions
   - Closures

## Description
1. Task 1 — Optionals
   - Create a variable which hold an optional value and assign `nil` to it
   - Print the variable if it is not `nil`
   - Assign the same variable a NOT `nil` value
   - Print the variable if it is not `nil`
2. Task 2 — Loops
   - Create an array with 5 names
   - Print the names in the array using a loop
3. Task 3 — Reuse
   - Create a function that takes a price and a discount value and returns the price after the discount
   - Print the value of the function when the price=100 & discount=0.5
   - Print the value of the function when the price=200 & discount=0.25
4. Task 4 — Conditionals
   - Create a variable that holds a student GPA
   - If the GPA is above 3 print nice ;)
   - If the GPA is below 3 print not nice :(
   - If the GPA is 3 print nice and not nice :)
5. Task 5 — Conditionals (Bonus 🚀)
   - There is no universal rule about when to use if-else and when to use switch. Sometimes, we prefer one over the other just because of readability. Let's say, you typically get a bonus at the end of each year. Now you are making a plan for your next travel destination. Here is the plan:
      - If you get a bonus of $10000 (or more), you will travel to Paris and London.
      - If the bonus is between $5000 and $9999, you will travel to Tokyo.
      - If the bonus is between $1000 and $4999, you will travel to Bangkok.
      - If the bonus is less than $1000, you just stay home.
   - Write a Swift program that making a plan for your next travel destination based on the bonus at the end of each year
